# Embedded ML Projects Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of projects completed as part of an Embedded Machine Learning curriculum. Each project is contained within its own directory and includes source code, a detailed report, and a specific README file.

## Projects

#### ➡️ [Project 1: Reactive State Machine](https://github.com/ChinmayAmrutkar/Embedded-ML-Projects/tree/main/Project1-Reactive-StateMachine)
* **Description:** An implementation of a reactive state machine on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense.
* **Key Concepts:** State management, hardware I/O (RGB LED), non-blocking timers (`millis()`), and serial communication for user input.
* **Status:** ✅ Complete

#### ➡️ [Project 2: Lying Posture Detection](https://github.com/ChinmayAmrutkar/Embedded-ML-Projects/tree/main/Project2-Posture-Detection)
* **Description:** A real-time system that detects a user's lying posture (supine, prone, side) using the onboard accelerometer.
* **Key Concepts:** IMU (BMI270) accelerometer, data-driven algorithm design, sense-process-act model, real-time systems, sampling frequency analysis.
* **Status:** ✅ Complete
